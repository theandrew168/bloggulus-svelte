# query

This directory contains all of the application's "queries" (aka read operations) for the web-based user interface.
Specific implementations of these interfaces (such as with a PostgreSQL database) are nested within subdirs.
Other potential user interfaces (mobile app, REST API, etc) are likely to have a different of queries.
